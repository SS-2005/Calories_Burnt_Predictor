# Predictive Model Project
This is  ML basic and simple project to determine the amount of calories burnt wrt to the duration of exercise in minutes
This repository contains a predictive model built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The project allows users to analyze datasets,Evalue Predictions, and apply predictive modeling techniques. 

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Cleaning and Visualizations
- Predictive modeling using machine learning techniques
- User Interface 

## Usage
1. Install and Import all the required Libraries.

2. Upload the Dataset (CSV) in google colab while executing the dataset should contain 2 columns strictly for our model to work.

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Upload your dataset .
   - Cleaning of data and filling of missing values
   - Plotting (Values and regression line)
   - Train and evaluate predictive model.
   - Enter a number to predict the amount of calories burnt

Thank you !...
